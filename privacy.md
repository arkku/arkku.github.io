# Privacy Policy

This is the privacy policy for the website **{{ site.title }}** (this Website).

Cookies[^2] may be used by this Website to store information about your
preferences (mainly your consent to allow cookies), as well as for general
analytics[^1] and visitor behavior tracking. This Website does not store such
cookies unless you explicitly agree to them by clicking the button that
should appear on your first visit, but some functionality on this Website
will be limited unless you do. For information about Google Analytics
in particular, please refer to [Google Privacy
& Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites){:rel='nofollow' target='blank'}.

This Website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages){:rel='nofollow' target='blank'}.
Some scripts used by this Website are hosted on [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/){:rel='nofollow' target='blank'}.
Like any web server, these services may collect and process information about visits to this
website, including IP addresses, browser type and platform. Please consult their
respective privacy policies on what this data may be used for.

Embedded content—such as social media, videos and photos—on this Website may
be hosted on other services (Hosting Services). When such content is loaded by
your browser, the Hosting Service may obtain your IP address and possibly some
previously stored cookies for that Hosting Service (e.g., if you have an
account on that service or have visited another website that uses the same
Hosting Service). In particular, this means that your account for a service
(such as Facebook or Google) may be identified by that service as being
the one that accesses the content on this site. In some cases a Hosting Service
may also be able to identify your browser as being the same that accessed
content on the same Hosting Service on another website.[^3]

Some pages on this Website use Facebook Comments to enable visitors to comment
on the page. Any comments you choose to post using this feature are publicly
visible and traceable to your Facebook account, subject to
[Facebook's Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy){:rel='nofollow' target='blank'}.

By using this Website, you consent to this Privacy Policy. You may withdraw
your consent at any time by ceasing to use this Website, and by removing any
cookies for `{{ site.title }}` from your browser settings.

[^1]: **Analytics** provides statistics and _general_ information about visitors. Since I
      have no access to statistics of the hosting service on this site, I rely on external
      analytics to know what content, if any, is interesting to visitors, which helps
      motivate and decide about creating new content.

[^2]: **Cookies** are small pieces of text stored by your browser for websites. They are used
      to "remember" things, e.g., to identify that your browser is the same that was seen
      earlier, or to store your preferences. You may view and delete cookies in your browser settings.

[^3]: **Cross-site tracking** happens when a service tracks you across multiple different
      websites (that have some content, features, and/or ads hosted by that service) by
      means of cookies and/or various "fingerprinting" methods. You may be able to mitigate
      this somewhat by enabling "tracking prevention" in your browser settings.
