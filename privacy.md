# Privacy Policy

This is the privacy policy for the website {{ site.title }} (this Website).

Cookies[^1] may be used by this Website to store information about your
preferences (mainly your consent to allow cookies), as well as for general
analytics and visitor behavior tracking. For Google Analytics in particular,
please refer to [Google Privacy
& Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

This Website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages).
Like any web server, GitHub may collect and process information about visits to this
website, including IP addresses, browser type and platform.

Embedded content—such as social media, videos and photos—on this Website may
be hosted on other services (Hosting Services). When such content is loaded by
your browser, the Hosting Service may obtain your IP address and any previously
stored cookies for that Hosting Service (e.g., if you have an account on that service).
In particular, this means that your account for a service (such as Facebook or Google)
may be identified by that service as being the one that accesses the embedded content.
This information may be used to provide social features and to personalize your experience.

Some pages on this Website use Facebook Comments to enable visitors to comment
on content. Any comments you choose to post using this feature are publicly visible
and traceable to your Facebook account, subject to [Facebook's privacy
policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy).

By using this Website, you consent to this Privacy Policy. You may withdraw
your consent at any time by ceasing to use this Website, and by removing any
cookies for `{{ site.title }}` from your browser settings.

[^1]: Cookies are small pieces of text stored by your browser for websites. They are used to "remember" things across different pages and visits on the same website, e.g., to identify that your browser is the same browser that visited another page on the same website. You may view and delete cookies in your browser settings.
